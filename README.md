Web-shooter, the camera-to-cloud photo management application for only the laziest of souls.

This was a hackathon product that the team worked for a few hours on - it has a partial data ingest feature (camera-to-cloud without a reverse proxy for the camera using the CCAPI isn't possible yet), a landing page, and oAuth for google photos as the eventual endpoint for the data being managed.

This is not a product or a tool that is ready for use, we just got it semi-demo ready. Feel free to clone or fork it if you want.
